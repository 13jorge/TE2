    <h1>First Original Image</h1>
    <img class="image1" src="images/original.jpg" alt=" first original image" />
    <h1>Resized Image</h1>
    <p>
      First I used a compression website to comprise the image and than I took
      the image to Photoshop to resize it and make sure the DPI was adequate for
      the web.
    </p>
    <img src="images/resize.jpg" alt=" first resized image" />
    <h1>Dithered Image</h1>
    <p>
      Lastly I took the image into a dithering program to change the way the
      image looks.
